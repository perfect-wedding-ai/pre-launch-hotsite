### Detailed Instructions for Generating High-Quality Prompts for Flux-PRO

0. **Prompts always in english**

1. **Use Natural, Detailed Language**  
   - **Clarity is Key:** Write complete sentences that fully describe the intended image. Avoid using just a string of keywords. For example, instead of “sunset, mountain, calm,” write “A serene sunset over a rugged mountain landscape, with soft pastel hues in the sky and a calm, reflective lake in the foreground.”  
   - **Include Descriptive Details:** Mention aspects such as subject, background, mood, color palette, and any technical details (e.g., camera type, lens, aperture) that can enhance the model’s understanding of the scene.  

2. **Structure the Prompt Logically**  
   - **Layering:** Divide your prompt into clear segments such as foreground, middle ground, and background. Specify what should appear in each layer. For example, “In the foreground, a vintage car is parked on a cobblestone street; in the middle ground, a bustling market scene unfolds; in the background, a misty castle looms on a distant hill.”  
   - **Sequential Description:** Order the details in a logical, hierarchical fashion to help the AI build the image progressively.  

3. **Be Specific and Precise**  
   - **Avoid Ambiguities:** Clearly define every element of the scene. If you require particular details (such as “a left arm extended horizontally”), state them exactly.  
   - **Technical Accuracy:** When aiming for photorealism, include specific camera settings (e.g., “shot on iPhone 16, aperture f/1.8, wide-angle lens”) to guide the model toward the desired output.  

4. **Incorporate Tone, Style, and Atmosphere**  
   - **Mood and Aesthetics:** Describe the desired mood, whether it is vibrant, melancholic, whimsical, or any other tone. Also, add stylistic references if needed (e.g., “in the style of a watercolor painting” or “reminiscent of a vintage postcard”).  
   - **Contrast and Juxtaposition:** If applicable, mention any contrasting elements (e.g., “a split composition with the left side in bright, sunny colors and the right side in dark, moody tones”) to create visual interest.  

5. **Iterate and Refine**  
   - **Prompt Experimentation:** Encourage iterative refinement. If the initial output isn’t perfect, adjust the language or add more specific modifiers (e.g., “with emphasis on lighting details” or “add a soft focus effect to the background”).  
   - **Feedback Loop:** Generate multiple versions and compare results, then fine-tune the descriptions for better adherence to the desired prompt.

6. **Avoid Common Pitfalls**  
   - **Overloading with Conflicting Details:** Do not mix too many contrasting ideas without clear structure. Keep the prompt focused on a coherent vision.  
   - **Incorrect Syntax or Unsupported Features:** Avoid using prompt weight syntax or any symbols that the Flux model might not support. Instead, use descriptive phrases such as “with a focus on…”  

7. **Encourage Creative Freedom Within Constraints**  
   - **Balance Detail with Flexibility:** While specificity is important, allow the model some creative latitude. Provide enough detail to guide the generation, but leave room for creative interpretation that may enhance the output.
   - **Inspire Curiosity:** Use language that sparks exploration. For example, “Imagine a futuristic city where nature and technology blend seamlessly, with hints of art deco and cyberpunk aesthetics.”
